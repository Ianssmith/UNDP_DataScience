UNDP s Project on  Inequality in Sub Saharan Africa 
This is one of the background papers on the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa s  RBA  comprehensive inequality study in Sub Saharan Africa  The study intends to contribute to the growing debates on inequality in the continent  Essentially  it aims to understand what factors explain trends in inequality and their positive and negative outcomes and to draw relevant policy lessons that could help the design and formulation of public policies and programs to address inequality in the continent 
Objectives of the study
The specific objectives of the research project are to 
 i  Provide a comparative analysis of inequality and examine several forms of elasticity of poverty and inequality across African countries and sub regions 
 ii  Identify key factors responsible for the inequality and poverty changes observed in Sub Saharan Africa during the last twenty years  so as to orient future policies towards inclusive growth  An important objective is to identify best practice policies and programs in countries that have experienced favourable progress on inequality trends over the past decade 
 iii  Examine empirically whether the countries which experienced a transition to democracy and the election of more accountable governments experienced improvements in growth and or inequality  and assess whether trade offs  if any  between these two are unavoidable or can lead to win win situations 
 iv  Analyze the relative importance of various economic  social and political factors in the observed changes in inequality and poverty in different clusters of economies  and
 v  Identify existing bottlenecks still impeding rapid progress such as dependence on commodity exports  weak industrial policy  reliance on volatile foreign savings  as well as other impediments that could hinder progress in sustaining an inclusive pro poor growth in the future

I  Introduction
Africa s poverty challenge is well known and widely researched  Approximately a third of the world s poor live in Africa  More recently  evidence shows that inequality may indeed be a more significant challenge in Africa than in other regions of the developing world  High levels of poverty and inequality persist in Africa in spite of it being one of the fastest growing regions in the last decade  In particular  six of the world s ten fastest growing economies during 2001 2010 were in sub Saharan Africa  SSA   The Economist and IMF  2011   Specifically  the fastest growing economy in the world in this decade was Angola  followed by Nigeria  Ethiopia  Chad  Mozambique  Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea 
For Africa  the period from the 1970s through to the late 1990s can in general be considered lost decades since independence  This period has been characterized by  a combination of serious governance failures  low and sub optimal investment in health  education and other social services  significant macroeconomic imbalances  poor infrastructure  and structural trade deficits  The post 2000 African economic boom  in contrast  has been built on a composite of factors  including technology  mobile in particular   demographic growth  urbanization and the rise of new dynamic African cities  improved macro economic policy  enhanced regional cooperation and integration  better targeted social policy  and significant increases in the quality of governance and institutions  In turn  these factors have enabled the growth momentum on the continent to be maintained  Africa s socio economic variables have not  however  matched this impressive economic performance  poverty and higher levels of inequality remain a feature of many African economies  Within this context  this paper aims to look more closely at the evolution of inequality on the continent over time  as well as some of its key drivers 
There are three stylized facts about the growth poverty inequality linkages that have emerged out of studies on developing economies  summarized well by Ferriera and Ravallion  2008   First  growth rates among developing countries are virtually uncorrelated with changes in inequality  Second  in the absence of the above relationship  there must be a strong relationship between growth and changes in poverty  Empirical evidence has strongly shown that faster growing economics reduce poverty more rapidly  Finally  high initial inequality reduces the poverty reducing power of growth  and more so if inequality rises through the growth process  This paper will build on these stylized facts to shed light on the nature and size of  the changes in  and the drivers of inequality in the African context 
The structure of the paper consists of the following  Section I  which provides the introduction  Section II  which provides a brief review of the international literature on growth  poverty and inequality interactions  Section III  which explores the growth poverty inequality interactions in the African context and focuses on describing the shape and size of inequality in Africa  Section IV  which investigates in more detail the potential drivers of inequality in Africa  and Section V concludes 
II  Growth  Poverty and Inequality Interactions  A Brief Literature Review
There is very little debate  if any  among economists around the notion that a high level of economic growth is essential for poverty reduction  Indeed  increased growth rates  effectively measured by rising per capita mean incomes  would appear to make this link clear  rising growth rates will yield lower poverty levels in the society  Cross country results indicate that the absolute value of the elasticity of poverty with respect to economic growth  as measured by the survey mean income or consumption  ranges from 1 to 5  with an average of 3  Ravallion and Chen  1997   Hence  there is strong evidence that economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction  The range of values  however  suggests that some economies are more able to achieve pro poor growth than others  indicating that economic growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition for poverty reduction

Chapter II  Growth  Poverty and inequality interactions  A Brief Literature Review
One overriding factor in understanding the growth poverty linkage is how it is intermediated through distribution of income  Once inequality is allowed to change in the modelling of the welfare consequences of economic growth  the impact on poverty is unclear  Kanbur  2004  Kanbur and Squire  1999   Indeed  arguably the most important welfare consequence from growth  in terms of its impact on poverty  is how this growth process impacts on the distribution of income  The consequent literature  driven by the work for example of Kakwani  1993   Datt and Ravallion  1992   Ravallion  2001  1997   Ravallion and Datt  2002   Bourguignon  2002   and Kanbur  2005   have attempted  in different ways  to provide a more accurate and careful representation of the interaction between economic growth  poverty and inequality  The evidence thus far  while far from establishing a consensus view  arrives at the following key deductions on the basis of empirical  largely cross country based evidence  First  growth that is accompanied by a rise in income inequality will dissipate the impact of the former on poverty reduction  Indeed  this is more easily shown through simple theoretical cases  but it is true that the impact of economic growth on poverty depends on the extent to which inequality has increased  As Ravallion  2001  has indicated  spells of growth during the 1980s in a sample of economies including Bangladesh  China  Colombia  India  Philippines and Viet Nam  witnessed the dilution of the impact on household poverty through rising income inequality  The often apparently minor changes in the relevant inequality measure   usually the Gini coefficient   belie the dramatic impact that these shifts can have on poverty reduction outcomes from growth 
Second  evidence seems to suggest that the initial level of income inequality within an economy is important in predicting the magnitude of the impact of growth on poverty  Ravallion  1997  Clarke  1999  Ravallion  2001  Adams  2004   Specifically  higher levels of initial income inequality are likely to be associated with a lower impact on poverty from growth  all things being equal  This is to be expected  given that an initial maldistribution of physical  human and financial resources should make it much harder for the poor to participate in  and therefore gain from  the process of economic growth  Ravallion  2004   for example  illustrates through cross  country evidence how  at very high levels of initial income inequality within his sample  growth poverty elasticities are not significantly different from zero  Indeed  this relationship is particularly important in our context here  given  as elucidated in greater detail below  the high Gini coefficients observed for sub Saharan Africa  SSA  relative to many other regions of the world 
A final thread of the evidence linking poverty  economic growth and inequality revolves around the sensitivity of measures of income inequality to changes in economic growth  Hence  much of the international evidence here suggests that measures of income inequality do not alter significantly with economic growth  Li  Squire and Zou  1998   The growth inequality relationship therefore tends to be relatively inelastic  since large changes in growth rates are required for significant distributional shifts in a society  Kanbur and Squire  1999  Kakwani  1993   Notably  there is little if any consistent evidence of large and significant declines in inequality accompanying episodes of economic growth  In many cases  then  societies on a path of successive years of growth should expect more inelastic growth inequality outcomes than possibly that of growth and poverty 
The Africa specific literature on the growth poverty inequality linkages is sparse  Fosu  2009  finds that  consistent with previous work  initial inequality differences can lead to substantial differences in the growth  poverty elasticity  not only between SSA and other regions  but also between countries within SSA  Recent work by Fosu  2014   which decomposes poverty changes during the early 1990s and the late 2000s for 23 African countries  shows that economic growth explains the majority of the changes in poverty for the group of countries experiencing poverty reduction  However  where poverty increased  inequality was more important in explaining the change  Importantly  even among those countries that experience declining poverty  for a few of them  declining inequality was the dominant factor  This heterogeneity points to the importance of country specific studies  Each country s growth poverty inequality relationship is no doubt influenced by issues relating to natural resource dependence  conflict and fragility  and governance issues  However  currently  there is little systematic evidence of the evolution of growth poverty or growth inequality

III  Growth  poverty and inequality  The African context
In the last two decades  the high poverty levels in Africa and associated development issues have taken centre  stage in the African development literature  Much has been documented about changes in poverty levels  the growth poverty elasticities and the macroeconomic drivers of poverty  Over this time  the issue of inequality has arguably been relatively neglected  possibly in part due to the lack of credible time series data on changes in the income distribution in African economies 1
The nature  size and pattern of inequality in Africa
More recently  it has increasingly been acknowledged that some of the most unequal economies in the world are in Africa  Using the Gini coefficient as the measure of within country income inequality  Table 1 shows that the average Gini coefficient in Africa is 0 43  which is 1 1 times the coefficient for the rest of the developing world  at 0 39  Furthermore  the upper bound of the continent s range of Gini coefficients exceeds that of the developing world  indicating that extreme inequality is also a distinct feature on the African continent  Using another measure of income inequality  shows that  on average  the top 20 per cent of earners in Africa have an income that is over 10 times that of the bottom 20 per cent  For other developing economies  this average is below 9

Chapter III  Growth  poverty and inequality  The African context
    The highest gini coefficient in the  Other developing countries  category  at 0 61  is found in the
small island nation of the Federated States of Micronesia  and has been excluded here for comparability purposes 
   Significant at the 5  level    Significant at the 10  level 
 Therefore  while the extent of measured inequality may differ according to different measurement techniques  the overall message is that inequality in Africa is high in both absolute and relative terms  The notion of a cluster of high inequality African economies is also an important component of this comparative exercise 
The distribution of Gini coefficients as illustrated in Figure 1 shows that the African distribution lies to the right of that of the rest of the developing world  which confirms the earlier observation that Africa s average levels of inequality are higher than other developing countries  In fact  60 per cent  30 out of 50  of the African countries in this sample fall above the median Gini coefficient of all developing economies  In addition  Kolmogorov Smirnov tests for equality of distributions are rejected at the 5 per cent level  suggesting that the distribution of inequality in Africa is distinct from that for the rest of the developing world

An outstanding feature of this graph is the prevalence of extreme inequality in Africa  which is not observed in other developing economies  There are 15 African countries in the fourth quartile of the entire distribution of Gini coefficients for all developing economies  Furthermore  there are seven outlier African economies that have a Gini coefficient of above 0 55  Angola  Central African Republic  Botswana  Zambia  Namibia  Comoros and South Africa  Some of these are Southern African middle income countries  South Africa  Namibia  Botswana and Zambia   which all exhibit considerably high levels of inequality  with Gini coefficients within the 0 57 0 64 range  Notably  however  some of the fast growing  populous countries on the continent such as Nigeria  United Republic of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  have significantly lower Gini coefficients of between 0 34 and 0 44

Using the population data from the World Development Indicators  WDI 2014   the population weighted Gini for Africa was calculated as 0 41  around 10 per cent of the African population live in the seven most unequal economies  A further 50 per cent of the African population live in countries with a Gini coefficient in the range of 0 402 to 0 505 
Given the poor quality of historical economic data  it is difficult to assess the changes in inequality in Africa over time  However  the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research  UNU  WIDER  world income inequality dataset  WIID  has compiled the best available Gini coefficients over time  which are used in Figure 2  The estimates show that for Africa  on average  there has been a slight reduction in the Gini coefficient from 0 48 during the early 1990s to the current level of 0 43   an 11 per cent decline

When excluding the seven outlier African economies  it can be observed that the average Gini coefficient for the rest of the continent declines from 0 45 in the early 1990s to a current level of 0 40  a 9 per cent decline   Notably  this latter average when compared with the data in Table 1 is almost equal to that of the rest of the developing world  In essence  the data here would suggest that it is the seven extremely unequal African countries  then  that are driving the results that place African inequality levels above that of other developing economies  The most recent Gini coefficients for these seven countries have an average of 0 51  Figure 3  in turn  emphasizes the fact that after 1999  the overall decline in inequality in Africa has been driven disproportionately by the decline in inequality of the  low inequality  sub sample of African economies  The cohort of  high inequality  African economies have jointly served to restrict the aggregate decline in African inequality

These averages  however  hide much of the variation observed across different countries  Figure 3 plots the Gini coefficient for a few African countries where there are sufficient data points  and it is clear that countries such as Egypt  Malawi and Madagascar have witnessed a narrowing of the income distribution over time  whereas Côte d Ivoire  South Africa and Uganda have experienced a rise in inequality since the 1990s  According to the available data  South Africa remains the most unequal African country  and indeed  one of the most unequal in the world

Chapter III  Growth  poverty and inequality  The African context
In addition to Angola  Ethiopia and Sierra Leone  many of the continent s fastest growing economies have also witnessed rising inequality over time  A review of the literature confirms this heterogeneous experience of African countries regarding the changes in the Gini coefficient over time  Bigsten and Shimeles  2004  analyse trends in inequality in a many African countries  primarily over the 1990s  and find very mixed results  In nine of the 17 countries in their dataset  the Gini coefficient decreased  in six countries  it increased  and in two  it stayed almost the same  Their analysis is problematic given the variation in time periods for different countries   for example  for Kenya  changes over only two years were examined  whereas for Ethiopia  over 14 year time period  Nonetheless  individual country studies have revealed varying changes in inequality over a number of African countries such as United Republic of Tanzania  Demombynes and Hoogeveen  2004   Nigeria  Canagarajah and Thomas  2001   Uganda  Appleton  1999  Ssewanyana et al  2004  and Zambia  McCulloch et al  2000  
Reliable time series data for individual countries are required to fully understand whether there may be some kind of Kuznets turning point in the evolution of inequality over time in Africa  While the threshold level at which inequality is expected to decline is not known  the cross country evidence in Table 1 shows no reversal in income inequality as African countries progress to upper middle income status  Supporting this view  earlier work in 1990s analysing growth spells in Africa find no such Kuznets effect  see Fields  2000 for a review of this literature   and in these studies  half of the growth spells were associated with increased inequality and in the other half  inequality decreased  To conclude  it is neither the rate of economic growth nor the stage of development  but the sources of growth that really matter in our assessment of the relationship between economic growth and inequality

Figure 6 shows that there is a weak relationship between the rate of economic growth and the change in the Gini coefficient for a large sample of African economies  However  the relationship is visibly stronger for the subset of economies that have an initially high Gini coefficient 2
as represented by the green fitted line  In addition  the correlation between initial inequality and current inequality for the above sample of African countries is statistically significant  at the 1 per cent level  with a magnitude of 0 56  These results only show that initial inequality can potentially explain a large proportion of the current levels of inequality  emphasizing the path dependent nature of the phenomenon  It would also follow  then  that not only do the sources of growth matter for inequality  but so do initial conditions 
The synthesis of the authors  own observations and the findings in the literature point to a set of early conclusions  First  it is difficult to derive a clear and consistent storyline around the nature and pattern of inequality across Africa given the substantial variation in both levels and changes over time  Second  it can be suggested although the data provisionally point to the fact that inequality has on average declined in Africa  it is driven mostly by the economies not classified as highly unequal  Third  Africa has a higher mean and median level of inequality than the rest of the developing region  Fourth  an important feature of inequality on the continent is the presence of the  African outliers   seven economies exhibiting extremely high levels of inequality  When excluding these African outliers  it is evident that Africa s level of inequality approximates those of other developing economies  Finally  estimating the relationship between growth and inequality suggests that for countries with initially high inequality  there is a stronger relationship between economic growth and inequality 
Africa s growth poverty inequality nexus
Despite the remarkable macroeconomic performance of Africa over the last decade  the continent has fallen behind in its goal of poverty reduction  While extreme poverty has fallen since 1990  almost 50 per cent of Africa s population  413 million people  continue to live below the extreme poverty line  Figure 7 shows that poverty is now falling in Africa  but not as rapidly as in South and East Asia  This has resulted in Africa s share of global poverty increasing from 22 per cent in 1990 to 33 per cent in 2010  Africa Progress Panel  2014

Chapter III  Growth  poverty and inequality  The African context
Across most of Africa  except North Africa  the proportion of the population living below the extreme poverty line is similar on average  at 39 46 per cent of population  Figure 7   This is significantly higher than the poverty rates in the other developing regions of South Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean  LAC   For example  the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in Central Africa is 2 5 times that of South Asia and 4 6 times that of LAC  Clearly  there are marked variations in poverty levels across the different countries  Four of the most populous countries in Africa  Nigeria  Ethiopia  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania  are home to almost half of Africa s poor  which inextricably links Africa s progress in reducing poverty to the performance of these countries 
Furthermore  the depth of poverty in Africa is more extreme  For those living below the poverty line in Africa  the average consumption level is only US  70 a day  considerably below the level in other regions  which are all nearly approaching the  1 a day level  Africa Progress Panel  2014   This can also be seen in Figure 8  where around two thirds of the population in the four African regions  excluding North Africa  living below the  2 a day poverty line are living in extreme poverty  around one third live on   25 to  2 a day  In contrast  in South Asia  60 per cent of the poor live on average incomes between  1 25 and  2 a day

Note  Authors calculated average poverty rates per region using the United Nations regional classifications 
Clearly  there are obstacles to Africa s poverty reducing power of growth  Indeed  the estimated growth elasticity of poverty in the two decades since 1990 in SSA is  0 7  which implies that a 1 per cent growth in consumption is estimated to reduce poverty by 0 7 per cent  Figure 9   For the rest of the world  excluding China   however  this elasticity is substantially higher  at  2 
An important factor mediating the growth poverty relationship is  expectedly  inequality  Higher initial inequality has been shown to hamper the poverty reducing effects of growth  Ravallion  1997  Fosu  2009   In particular  Fosu  2009  calculates the income growth elasticities for 30 countries in SSA over the 1977 2004 period and reveals substantial variation in the estimates  from 0 63 in Namibia  a highly unequal country  to 1 4 in Ethiopia

In addition  as noted above  it is not only growth that matters  but also where the sources of growth are located  Evidence has shown that growth in labour intensive sectors such as agriculture or manufacturing are typically more poverty reducing than growth in capital intensive sectors such as mining  Ravallion and Datt  1996  Khan  1999  Ravallion and Chen  2007  Loayza and Raddatz  2010   The growth path of many African economies where resource extractive industries are dominant would thus be an important determinant of the observed low growth poverty elasticities for the region

Note  Controls include initial consumption  inequality and an indicator for a natural resource share  5  of GDP  Country fixed effects are controlled for in all results 
Supporting the importance of these factors  it can be observed that when they are controlled for through a variety of variables  the growth elasticity of poverty in SSA approaches that of the rest of the world  Figure 9   The impact of growth on poverty reduction is lower when initial inequality and mineral resource dependence are higher  World Bank  2013b  
High and rising levels of inequality is an important hindrance to poverty alleviation on the continent  arguably the biggest development challenge of the century  The following sections uncover some of the important drivers of inequality in Africa  within which it is argued  resource dependence plays a central role

Despite the recent growth rates recorded in Africa  there is a genuine concern regarding the long term sustainability of Africa s rapid economic expansion and importantly  whether this high growth at the country level can be translated into achieving key development objectives  such as poverty reduction  a more equitable distribution of income  enhanced human capital accumulation  and improved infrastructure  The drivers of economic growth are then critical to understanding whether growth is likely to be sustainable  and more importantly  more inclusive  Economic theory and cross country experience have indicated that a more diverse economic base increases the probability of a sustained economic performance at the country level  This is also true because it more likely that the gains from growth driven by a more diverse range of economic sectors will be more equitably distributed  As discussed below  a more equitable income distribution results in a middle class that is able to act as the driver of domestic consumption

Chapter IV  Drivers of Inequity in economic growth patterns
Structural transformation is the reallocation of labour from low  to high productivity sectors  and the rate of this change can boost growth significantly  In Rodrik s  2014  typology of growth processes  it can be observed that rapid industrialization or structural change to high productivity sectors can quickly shift countries into middle  or upper income status  This highlights his evidence that modern manufacturing industries exhibit unconditional convergence to the global productivity frontier  Rodrik  2014   This is the classic pattern of growth in low income countries where surplus labour moves from agricultural activities to industrial jobs  spurred by an export led economic diversification strategy  In the later stages of this development process  however  growth begins to disproportionately rely on fundamental capabilities such as the availability and quality of institutions and human capital  For countries further along in the development process  i e  middle  income countries   growth tends to be more capital  and skills intensive  and more reliant on the services sector  In these countries  domestic demand is a key element of sustaining economic growth  and therefore  the impact that growth has on the distribution of income  insofar as it affects the size of the middle class  is an important growth challenge  Kharas and Kohli  2011   In the first section  it was evident that several middle income Southern African economies exhibit high levels of income inequality  which points to a small middle class  and that these economies have been growing at rates below comparator countries  It is in these contexts that the complexity of the growth inequality poverty nexus is fully revealed 
In Africa  the agricultural sector remains an important contributor to GDP  particularly in West  East and Central Africa  where it contributes 29 per cent  36 per cent  and 40 per cent of GDP  respectively  Table 2   Over time  however  there has been a gradual shift away from the traditional agricultural sector  but not towards manufacturing as in the classic pattern of economic development  as experienced by the European industrialisers and more recently  East Asia  Where industry3 has grown in Africa  it is dominated by mining activities  which indicates there has been a considerable decline in manufacturing value added since the 1990s and 2000s across the continent  In contrast  the tertiary services sector has absorbed most of the shift away from agriculture  becoming the largest share in GDP for most parts of the continent

A closer examination of the dynamics of the secondary sector across African economies shows that  at an individual country level  only 15 of the 50 African countries included in this sample have increased the share of manufacturing in GDP since 2000  with many of the changes of a small magnitude  Figure 10   Figure 10 plots the change in manufacturing as a percentage of GDP against the change in mining and utilities as a percentage of GDP over the 2000 2010 period  A process of positive structural change over this ten year period would be one where there is a shift from mining value added toward manufacturing value added   represented by quadrant one  Only six African countries in our sample fall into this category  In contrast  the figure shows that in most African economies   35 out of 50 here   mining and utilities have seen a rising share in GDP over the period  The fast growing  resource rich economies of Zambia  Burkina Faso  Chad  Guinea  and Côte d Ivoire have witnessed some of the largest shifts of economic activity toward these two sectors  Conversely  there are also the fast growing economies of Angola  Nigeria  Ghana and Mozambique that have seen large declines in mining and utilities over this period  However  these are economies that are starting off on an initially very

high base  since they yield very large shares of mining in GDP  For example  for Angola and Nigeria  mining and
utilities continue to contribute up to 53 per cent and 44 per cent of GDP  respectively

Overall  Africa s transition out of the primary sector predominantly into tertiary sector activities has not resulted in preferred economic development outcomes  This is because these activities are largely informal and not particularly productive  Hence  the growth of these largely informal sector activities are concentrated in low productivity areas of economic activity  In attempting to calibrate this shift  McMillan  Rodrik and Verduzco Gallo  2014  estimate that structural change in Africa between 1990 and 2005 made a sizeable negative contribution to overall economic growth by as much as 1 3 per cent per annum on average 4 Labour has moved in the wrong direction  toward less productive sectors 
Importantly  there is substantial heterogeneity in these African results  Nigeria and Zambia both exhibit negative structural change effects over the same 15 year period  where in both countries  the employment share of agriculture increased significantly  In Ghana  Ethiopia and Malawi  however  structural change over the 1990 2005 period was positive  in which the employment share of agriculture declined and that of manufacturing increased  MacMillan et al  2014  
4 A similar result was found for Latin America  Asia was the only of the three regions where the contribution of structural change to economic growth over this period was positive

Africa s growth path is therefore characterized by  being heavily dependent on natural resources  having experienced a poor performance of the manufacturing sector  that has the ability to absorb excess labour into higher productivity sectors  and having an over reliance on subsistence farming  Agricultural activities in Africa are largely low productivity activities  but retain a significant contribution to employment in many African countries  Furthermore  the skewed nature of land ownership and access to agricultural land is likely to have an important impact on incomes in rural areas  Although data on public investment in agriculture are sparse  data for 12 African countries show that only 3 2 per cent of total agricultural land is irrigated and the use of machinery  i e  tractors  is limited in this sample of economies  WDI  2014   Thus  the benefits of economic growth are accrued to more capital intensive sectors  This lack of economic diversification  particularly where there is a dependence on natural resources  makes African economies more vulnerable to external shocks  This may lead to a more volatile macroeconomic environment  which the poorest people are most vulnerable to 
Positive structural transformation is relevant to the discussion on inequality since a vibrant manufacturing sector will generate a large number of labour intensive firms  which in turn boost wage employment  This would compress the wage distribution and hence decrease income inequality  In contrast  capital intensive sectors have the potential to generate higher economic growth  but fewer jobs  Therefore  depending on the nature of the growth inequality relationship in each economy  impacted by the sources of growth and initial conditions   either of the above growth paths can have a different impact on the distribution of income 
V  Drivers of inequality in Africa  Microeconomic and institutional considerations
The section above clearly emphasizes the role of the economic structure and the location of sources of growth within it in impacting on the income distribution of an economy  Furthermore  the paper has highlighted the importance of initial levels of inequality in determining the evolution of inequality throughout the growth process  For Africa  these two drivers of inequality are often highly connected 
A historical institutional perspective provided by Acemoglu  Johnson and Robinson  2001   Acemoglu and Robinson  2010  and Bratton and van der Walle  1997  is summarized here  According to this literature  Africa has historically lagged behind in terms of institutional formation  An important factor behind Early Modern Europe s sustained economic growth was the reform of the state that moved away from absolutism  i e  where the power of the ruler is absolute and unconstrained by institutions  Acemoglu and Robinson  2010  and patrimonialism  i e  where the state is associated with the person of the ruler such that there is no distinction between the wealth or assets of the ruler and that of the state   While this transition was taking place in Western Europe  absolutism and patrimonialism were persisting in Africa and perhaps even intensifying  Thereafter  the 17th and 18th century intensification of the Atlantic slave trade catalysed warfare across the continent and fuelled the import of guns and ammunition that Europeans exchanged for slaves  This conflict and slavery had perverse effects on domestic economic and institutional formation  and distorted the incentives of those in power  institutions become  perverted by the desire to capture and sell slaves   Acemoglu and Robinson  2010  30   The end of the slave trade reduced the external demand for slaves  but gave rise to  legitimate commerce    i e  the export of African commodities to global economic powers   to which those who would have been sold as slaves were put to work in extractive industries  The subsequent impact of the European colonial period during the 19th century was to reinforce Africa s institutional path  remove the possibility of any endogenous institutional reform  and create the  dual economy   There was very little possibility for most Africans to transition from the traditional economy to the modern economy  or even acquiring the means to do so  such as education 
Post colonial Africa has largely been unable to reform the absolutist structures that were imbedded in colonial political and institutional systems  These ideas rely on a form of path dependence  Furthermore  European

colonial powers arbitrarily put together very different ethnic groups of people and created countries that
would be difficult to govern and vulnerable to conflict in the post colonial period 
It is also important to note that ethnic fractionalization remains a driver of horizontal inequalities since it impacts on the way the state implements policies and provides public goods and services  Stewart  2002   Using data from 18 SSA countries  Jackson  2013  shows that  in ethnically diverse communities  access to water  electricity and education is lower  For education  in particular  he finds that those belonging to the dominant ethnic group have higher access to education rates  The reasons driving this could be that the language of instruction at schools disadvantages minority children and reduces the value of their education  Another reason could be that minority groups have inferior labour market opportunities  lowering the returns to education for them relative to majority groups  Alwy and Schech  2004  confirm this finding for Kenya  where they show that access to education is higher and the quality of education is better in the provinces from which the ruling elite came from 
Finally  ethnic diversity has been shown to affect the ability of a community to act collectively  Collective action within ethnic groups has been shown to be more efficient than that between groups  and in effect  individuals in diverse communities are less willing to contribute to the public good  Vigdor  2004  Miguel and Gugerty  2005   This impacts on communities  ability to act together to hold governments accountable  thus perpetuating historical horizontal inequalities 
In summary  the high levels of initial inequality in SSA is related to how the natural endowments in the region shaped the nature of colonial institutions  van der Walle  2009  Bigsten and Shimeles  2004   These created the conditions for the high levels of inequality found today  High levels of inequality post independence in many African economies  it is argued  resulted largely from the fact that there were small European populations  that still retained wealth   small highly extractive administrations and a focus on law and order rather than economic development  Upon independence  then  wealth was transferred to only a small group of African elite  Furthermore  there were sub national tensions  ethnicity  religion and or race  that further determined the initial distribution of resources and may continue to determine the provision of public goods and access to labour market opportunities  Within this context  this section will thus attempt to explore in more detail the role of extractive industries in driving inequality in Africa  primarily through its impact on governance 
Natural resources and inequality
Figure 11 shows the distribution of inequality  as measured by the Gini index on the x axis  across resource  and non resource dependent countries in Africa  plotted in red and black  respectively  The distributions are weighted by the size of each country s population  which is measured on the y axis  The graph shows that for the bulk of countries in Africa  the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 3 to 0 5  While the average levels of inequality are relatively similar between resource  and non resource dependent economies  there is clearly a difference at the upper end of the inequality distribution  there are a number of resource dependent countries with very high levels of inequality  close to and above 60  This suggests that while there is no clear link between inequality and resource dependence on average  there is a greater risk of high inequality outcomes in resource dependent economies

Moreover  it will be shown that one of the key problems for resource dependent countries is not that they lack the revenues to achieve a more equitable growth path  but rather  that chronic governance and institutional failures prevent the effective use of large resource rents  One example is the lack of controls and safeguards needed to manage revenue flows from extractive industries so as to curb enormous illicit revenue outflows  which could cover health and education budgets many times over 
Drivers of inequality in resource rich countries
It has been widely reported that the commodity boom over the past decade has fuelled impressive growth performances in many African economies  However  this has not always translated into welfare gains for the populations of these economies  Due to rapidly rising income levels within highly unequal societies  the gains to growth have disproportionately accrued to the few richest  resulting in high levels of inequality and the widespread failures to meet many development targets  even by middle income countries like South Africa  Some of the important ways in which the reliance on extractive industries can drive within country inequality are outlined below 
The cross country evidence of the monotonic effect of resource dependence on growth and development is inconsistent  Robinson  Torvik and Verdier  2006   and there is a growing body of literature to suggest that the quality of institutions is critical in determining whether or not natural resources are a curse  The link between growth driven by the extractive industry and inequality is mediated through governing bodies and institutions  There is therefore some evidence to suggest that the impact of resources on development is mainly indirect  through the channels of institutional quality  Bulte  Damania and Deacon  2005   The state is arguably the most important agent that can catalyse the redistribution of income in highly unequal societies by implementing fair fiscal policies  including progressive tax collection and spending in quality public services  and regulating market structures 
There is no established literature on which to draw regarding the channels through which resource  dependence and institutions interact  but there are logical expositions as well as country examples that

Chapter V  Drivers of inequality in Africa  Microeconomic and Institutional considerations
guide our understanding  There are some studies that suggest that resource abundance can be a blessing for countries with good institutions and a curse for those with bad institutions  Mehlum  Moene and Torvik  2006   A view that extends this further  suggests that the institutional setting of a country is endogenous and changes with respect to resource endowments  Jensen and Wanchekon  2004   In this vein  the findings of an important study by Jensen and Wanchekon  2004  on Africa show that natural resource dependence can have a serious negative impact on both democratic transition and democratic consolidation  Collier and Hoeffler  1998   From the period 1970 to 1995  African countries with higher levels of resource dependence tended to be more authoritarian and were associated with higher government consumption and worse government performance  After an initial wave of democratization on the continent  more highly resource dependent countries slid back into authoritarian rule 5 Finally  there has been recent cross country evidence that the causality runs from weak institutions to resource dependence since these countries are unlikely to develop non primary production sectors  Brunnschweiler and Bulte  2006  
According to Freedom House s 2014 report  Political Rights 6 the scores of 55 African countries show that the most highly resource dependent countries have the worst performing scores on average regarding the electoral process  political pluralism and functioning government  Table 3   Most of the countries in this group of countries are not considered  free  according to Freedom House s scoring methodology

While there may not be a linear relationship between resource dependence and degree of political rights  there is some evidence that highly resource dependent economies are associated with lower levels of civil society engagement  less transparent electoral process and a less effective government  In sum  high resource  dependent economies are significantly more likely to be undemocratic than their African counterparts  Furthermore  the 13 countries that make up the top category include some of Africa s most populous countries such as Nigeria  the Democratic Republic of Congo and Algeria  which account for almost one third of Africa s population in total 
Due to the lack of robust empirical work on the subject  the causality in the resource governance link is poorly understood  One direction of causality runs from the discovery of natural resources leading to weakened institutions given the opportunity for the political capture of rents  This is independent of whether the country had initially strong or weak institutions  Over the last five years  there has been much optimism about new natural resource discoveries in the East Africa Rift Valley  oil  as well as natural gas off the coasts of Kenya

In 2012  there were already concerns of corruption in Uganda when lawmakers passed a new oil bill that included a clause stating that the Minister of Petroleum shall be responsible for granting and revoking licences  Reuters  2012   Furthermore  there the potential for cross country conflict in negotiating oil and gas deals  The Economist  2012  and within country conflict needs to be managed effectively  In the United Republic of Tanzania  the discovery of natural resources is now at the centre of the separatist movement debate between Zanzibar and the mainland since it remains unclear whether the responsibility of the extraction of oil and gas is that of Zanzibar  where it should create its oil petroleum company  or of mainland Tanzania 
When institutions are initially weak  i e  where natural resources are then discovered  or the economy becomes more dependent on natural resources   there is inherently a weaker ability to translate this type of growth into welfare gains  This also indicates that where a country initially has strong  transparent  and accountable institutions  the ability to optimize the benefits of natural resource driven growth is enhanced  A good example of this is Ghana  a country with a history of good institutions and resource dependence  and which after the discovery of offshore oil in 2007  has become more dependent on the natural resource sector to drive growth  Nonetheless  Ghana has continued to do well in improving the country s socio economic indicators 
Despite the studies mentioned above on the relationship between natural resources and institutions  the determinants of corruption and the channels through which institutional quality affects growth and development have in particular received little attention  Even within democratic states  there are specific mechanisms that reduce the effectiveness of resource revenues in contributing to economic and social development  and in particular to reducing inequality  A key channel is the provision of licences to allow for the extraction of natural resources  Opportunity for political capture of resource rents within the process of granting licences can arise when the process relies on the discretion of public officials  such as a Minister of Mining or Energy  and where there is no transparency in the process  Licensing  then  is a key portal through which rent seeking and corrupt practices may occur  Even in situations where there are the correct incentives in place for African authorities  they may not have the capacity to negotiate  administer and monitor the mining contracts in order to maximize the domestic benefits 
The high initial capital cost of entry into the natural resources markets can also lend itself to monopolistic or oligopolistic market structures  While this is not particular to the resource sector  it is a defining characteristic and a key reason that inequality outcomes may be perpetuated through a growth path of this form  in addition to the issue of higher pricing leading to a less than optimal allocation of resources in the economy  economic literature has highlighted two further problems associated with markets that are controlled by a single or few firms  first  the resulting excess economic profit from higher prices  transferred from consumers to the monopoly  may result in an inequitable distribution of income  and second  the concentration of income by the monopoly also provides it with greater political influence over policies that might alter the market structure  Therefore  the fact that there are few licences to be granted means that the lobbying by multinationals and other large companies for these licences lends itself to acts of corruption and bribery

According to the composite scores of the Resource Governance Index  Figure 12  7 which takes into account licensing and contracting procedures  32 of the 58 countries mentioned had weak or failing institutions  Half of these weak or failing states were African  Over 75 per cent of the African countries included in the index had weak or failing resource governance bodies  The positive developing country examples such as several Latin American countries included in the Index suggest  however  that mechanisms are available to overcome a possible bias toward weak institutions in resource dependent developing countries 
Second  as noted above  extractive industries are often characterized by their capital intensity  therefore limiting employment creation  Figure 6 shows that among the 20 African economies with the highest growth in capital formation  17 are resource dependent economies  most of which  as shown above  are the fastest growing economies on the continent  Where jobs are created within these extractive industries  they are often higher skilled jobs  Given that a low skills base is often characteristic of low income African countries  high skilled labour is often imported into these economies  These two factors of a low job creation quotient combined with a skills biased pattern of labour demand contribute to maintaining high levels of inequality and perhaps even increasing inequality levels 
The South African economy  for example  has historically struggled with a consistently high rate of unemployment  24 1 per cent  Stats SA  2013  and inequality  Gini index  65  World Bank  2011   For the 2001  2007 period  the South African economy had a simple output employment elasticity of only 0 64  Bhorat  Goga and Stanwix  2013   This decreased substantially in the 2008 2010 post crisis period to  0 16  which indicates that employment declined over this period  At the same time  however  the expansion in the South African economy was driven by tertiary sectors such as financial services and community services  which indicated that medium  and high skilled occupations experienced significant gains  Changes in the skills intensity of the South Africa labour force is expected to have implications on the distribution of income   increasing wage premia for higher skilled workers and declining wage premia for workers in jobs that involve automated or routine tasks  ibid

Third  which is related to the issue above  levels of beneficiation and secondary industry creation are relatively low  which again hinders wide scale job creation and in particular the creation of better quality jobs  Resource  dependent economies showing high growth in capital formation such as the Central African Republic and Côte d Ivoire have  as shown above  also seen manufactured goods as a percentage of GDP decline by 7 and 4 percentage points  respectively  from 2007 to 2011  World Development Indicators  2014   While this decline in manufacturing  shown earlier in Figure 10  is within the context of a lack of structural transformation  this phenomenon can also be explained as a symptom of the well established Dutch Disease  the crowding out of non resource investment  Papyrakis and Gerlagh  2004   or hampered financial sector growth  Beck  2011   However  potentially equally relevant is the emerging political economy literature that suggests that where elites are in control of resource revenues  they may be able to resist industrialization  which has the potential of diluting their political and economic power base  Isham et al  2003  
Fourth  lost resource revenues through illicit financial flows significantly deplete a country s tax revenues which could arguably be used for productive  distribution neutral or inequality reducing investment such as infrastructure upgrading and social services  Illicit financial flows occur through various channels  Due to the combination of tax incentives offered by developing countries and aggressive tax planning by multinational companies  they can minimize tax payments through profit shifting strategies 
Fifth  trade mispricing through intra company trade within complex company structures  Sixth  illegal tax evasion due to complex ownership structures and lack of transparency on beneficial ownership  And seventh  the presence of government corruption 
At the top of the investment chain in Africa s extractive industries are multinational corporate entities  which regularly report annual earnings that are  for example  11 and 14 times the GDP of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  respectively  The presence of offshore registered companies within these ownership structures limits public disclosure requirements and the use of subsidiaries and affiliates as conduits for intra  company trade creates opportunities for trade mispricing and tax avoidance sin companies can maximize the profit reported in low tax jurisdictions 
Finally  using WDI s data on Social Protection  it emerges that while all African countries perform poorly  highly resource dependent countries perform the worst  This further emphasizes the potentially skewed

distributional outcomes of resource revenues in these economies  A recent international Monetary Fund  IMF  report suggests that progressive taxation is underutilized in developing countries as a redistributive tool  with income tax in particular having the potential to significantly reduce inequality  as occurs in many more developed economies  IMF  2014  
Ultimately  then  the above has suggested that the state and its associated institutions are potentially able to intervene in ways that reduce the potential inequalities arising from a dependence on natural resource sectors  There are  however  a number of potential channels through which a natural resource dependent economy may lead to rising inequality  Through the political capture of rents  through ineffective and unprogressive tax systems or overly complicated ownership structures of extractive industry companies  when industrialization and human capital upgrading strategies are poorly realized  and when states do not fully consider appropriate social welfare programmes  The latter in particular has been shown to be effective in improving the well being of citizens in other developing countries such as South Africa  These problems in turn are all inextricably linked to poor governance and a lack of transparency in government expenditure collection and allocations 
Governance and institutions
Despite the governance and institutional challenges that remain in most African countries  the continent has transitioned toward more democratic leadership over the last two decades  According to Freedom House  there were only four full electoral democracies in Africa in 1990  which increased to 20 countries by this year  While democratization has come in waves  with countries shifting between democratic and other regimes  democratic principles are becoming entrenched in some societies  Nonetheless  elections in Africa do not always produce representative governments and with poorly educated electorates  it is difficult to hold elected governments accountable 
The previous section focused more explicitly on the link between institutions related to natural resources and the possible impact on inequality  More generally  however  the state has the potential to play a key role in reducing inequality  Fundamentally  the effective management of public funds and investment in key areas such as education and job creating industries can only positively contribute toward narrowing the income distribution  Furthermore  it could also leave fiscal space for targeted social protection policies for the most vulnerable  Regulating market structures  as mentioned in the previous section  is also an important aspect of state regulation  which can help to create more equitable market structures 
These elements of governance go beyond following democratic processes and require the capacity to design and implement effective policies 8 regulate efficiently  and the political will to eradicate negative elements such as corruption that serves only to enrich political elites in otherwise low income countries  These are areas in which African governments perform poorly  Figure 15 shows selected governance indicators for African subregions over time 
 8 Even when public investments are made  they are often not equitably spread out within countries  This may drive inequality along spatial lines  for example  urban rural  and may exacerbate conflicts within countries

It is clear that  on average  corruption  i e  measured as perceptions of the extent to which public power is abused for private gain as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests  has worsened across the continent since the beginning of the 2000s  In addition  the quality of policy formation and implementation  and the credibility of the government s commitment to such policies are represented by  Government effectiveness  and show that  on average  governments have become less effective in these areas over the last decade  Overall  African countries score poorly on all of the above governance indicators  A positive trend is the improving score on  Voice and accountability   which indicates  as the rising democratization of the continent would suggest  that citizens are increasingly able to participate in selecting their governments and that there is greater freedom of expressions  association and the media  An active citizenry  with adequate space for non governmental organizations  NGOs  and civil society groups  is critical here to expose poorly performing governments and to demand better institutions that are focused on inclusive economic growth and development 
Demographic changes and the labour market
The nature and response of the labour market in the growth poverty inequality interactions is important  Two examples of where the labour market is important in this arena may strengthen this point  First  in the context of examining the inequality growth relationship  labour demand responses during growth episode of an economy will often shape and influence the private distributional consequences from growth  A typical example of this response on the basis of cross country evidence has been the advent of skills biased labour demand shifts  where domestic economies have witnessed a disproportionate increase in the demand for skilled relative to unskilled workers during the periods of economic growth  The non neutrality of response in the occupational labour demand function to economic growth is critical to understanding how economic growth can and does have distributional and poverty consequences

Chapter V  Drivers of inequality in Africa  Microeconomic and Institutional considerations
A second example of the relevance of the labour market to these broader debates is within the arena of initial income inequality  It is entirely possible that high levels of initial income inequality are in large part located within the labour market  High levels of initial wage inequality in a society may be precisely the labour market expression of how initial income inequality impacts on growth poverty elasticities  Relatively high wage incomes from the formal as opposed to the informal economy  for example  may be the key determinant of initial income inequality in a society 9 The reason  in turn  that Gini coefficients are so inelastic to economic growth may in part lie with the difficulty in  and long run returns to  altering an unequal and poor quality schooling system within an economy  Human capital formation must therefore feature as one of the key issues identifying both the cause and solution for overcoming the low growth poverty elasticities yielded through high inequality levels  This is particularly important when considering the projected demographic changes for Africa  where the growth of the young working age population is expected to be rapid 
The regional population growth rate projections for the 2010 2030 period are illustrated in Figure 15  It is evident from the graph that the population of the working age   defined as age 15 64   is projected to contract in Europe and grow in single digits for North America  The growth of the global workforce will be driven by Asia  Latin America and Africa  More specifically  the region projected to have the fastest growing working age population is Africa  This translates into a working age population of 793 million in 2030  a 70 per cent rise from the current 466 million  It is projected that in SSA there will be an additional 15 6 million people on average per year to the working age population in 2015 2020  rising to 17 2 million per year in 2020 2025  and to 19 million per year in 2025 2030 
Understanding the composition of the growth in the working age population is important given that it is the rapid entry of young workers that is most likely to put pressure on the labour market  The magnitude of the expected growth between 2010 and 2030 in Africa s youth population  15 24  is enormous  38 7  compared to  2 4  in Latin America and  7 1  in Asia  Figure 15   Lam and Leibbrandt  2013  provide an example from Africa s most populous country  Nigeria  to illustrate the extent of the youth bulge in Africa  They show that while the growth in the 15 24 age population in Nigeria has fallen from its mid 1990s peak  it is expected to remain above 2 per cent until 2030  resulting in Nigerian youth continuing to make up one third of the labour force for the entire period 
 9 It is through standard income source decompositions of the Gini coefficient  for example  see Lerman and Yitzhaki 1985   that one can empirically establish the contribution of regular wage or self employed income to overall inequality   relative to  for example  state transfers of interest income

The fact that Africa s working age population is expected to grow so rapidly  particularly the working youth  highlights that it is relatively not as far along in its demographic transition as many other regions of the world  While this implies a great opportunity for potential growth in the region  it also alludes to the increasing challenge of promoting growth that is job creating 
The above suggests that there are two main implications of Africa s projected demographic changes on its labour force  First  most of the world s working age population growth will emanate from Africa  From 10 per cent of the global labour force in 2010  this is set to increase to 15 per cent  ILO  2011   Second  most of this growth will originate from young workers in Africa  who are primed to stream into the labour market at an average annual rate of over 2 per cent10 in the 2010 2030 period 
Turning to the current global labour market landscape  Table 4 shows that of the 3 billion people in the global labour force  only half of them are in wage employment  which is loosely defined as employment in which one earns a wage  either formal  officially recognized contract  or informal  oral implicit contract   In SSA  however  a large majority  74 per cent  of the 297 million employed individuals are not in formal wage employment but  rather  are self employed 11 This indicates that the incomes of most of the employed in SSA are directly dependent on the profits of their enterprise  which are typically more variable than income from wage employment  Also unique to the region is that  on average  56 per cent of the labour force work in agriculture  compared to 25 per cent of the labour force in both other non OECD countries and for the global average  Ultimately  then  77 per cent of the self employed in SSA work in agriculture  compared with the corresponding figure of 55 per cent for other non OECD countries 
10 The total percentage change of young workers in SSA  age 15 24  over the 2010 2030 period is 55 per cent 
11 According to ILO  1993   wage employment refers to jobs  where the incumbents hold explicit  written or oral  or implicit
employment contracts which give them a basic remuneration     in the form of wages  Self employment is defined as  jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits  or the potential for profits  derived from the goods and services produced  where own consumption is considered to be part of profits

A segmented understanding of an African developing onomy labour market necessarily needs to account for informal work  but more particularly  informal agricultural work and associated labour dynamics  Since labour in the region primarily involves activities related to working on land in rural areas  typically low earning work   employment in the current context  self employed agricultural work with associated inadequate earnings  will not be sufficient to narrow the income distribution and thus reduce income inequality 
To show this relationship  Figure 16 plots the ratio of the wage share of employment to the agricultural share of employment against the Gini coefficient for a range of developing and developed countries across the world  There is a weakly negative relationship suggesting that  in countries with a high ratio of wage to agricultural employment  i e  where wage employment is sufficiently dominant  income inequality is lower  Much of Africa  however  is characterized by shares of wage employment that are too small within domestic labour markets  These small shares of largely urban  public sector wage jobs arguably exacerbate existing inequalities within the relevant economies

The typology of Africa s jobs challenge is evident in the above data  In the first instance  since agriculture is so central to the average African economy  policies designed to promote growth in this sector  increase its global competitiveness and essentially serve as mechanisms for reducing the incidence of working poverty are critical  Increased income generation through agriculture is a key avenue for a reduction in overall income inequality in Africa  Second  large numbers of predominantly young people are entering Africa s fast growing cities in search of employment  The majority end up in urban self employment or unemployment  Rendering the informal sector a more sustainable form of employment  creating linkages to the formal sector and providing an enabling business environment for this sector to thrive is essential to a more equitable growth path  Finally  growing Africa s currently miniscule wage employment base must be a key strategy to reduce inequality and grow domestic economies for African governments  Expanding the light manufacturing sector is only one important job generating growth strategy  which has worked in the high success economies of East Asia 
Education and human capital development
The achievement of a primary enrolment rate above 80 per cent in Africa  on average  has garnered much praise in the international development community  Beyond this  however  the core problem in overcoming the economic development constraint remains the upgrading of the level of human capital in most of Africa  The poor quality of educational systems together with poor post primary education enrolment rates are central to Africa s human capital challenge and to a more equal future growth and development trajectory  To show the extent to which secondary school enrolment has collapsed in Africa  Figure 17 illustrates the gap between primary and secondary school enrolment rates of countries in SSA against the rest of the regions of the world

2  The United Nations regional categories have been used to categorize countries  3  There are no data for secondary education enrolment in North Africa 
The figures make it clear that while SSA performance  in terms of primary school enrolment  lags behind that in other developing country regions of the world  it is the secondary school results that are disconcerting  The data reveal that for the 2012 cohort of learners  the median secondary schooling enrolment in SSA was approximately 30 percentage points below that found in South Asia and 57 percentage points lower than Western Asia  In addition  the secondary schooling enrolment was around 55 percentage points below the median for the world as a whole  Differential enrolment rates as one moves from primary to secondary schooling increase sharply and dramatically  These significant and large shifts in enrolment rates as one moves from primary to secondary schooling are strongly suggestive of a secondary schooling system within the SSA region that is significantly under performing relative to international comparators  For Africa to move its economy toward higher productivity sectors   not only to sustain growth  but also to reduce inequality by creating gainful employment for its citizens   it needs an adequate supply of skilled labour 
The regional variation in Table 5 shows that Central Africa has the lowest secondary school enrolment  with an almost 50 percentage point difference in primary and secondary enrolment  Excluding North Africa  which has the best performing enrolment rates in Africa  Southern Africa has the highest secondary enrolment rate  but the level is still less than half of primary school enrolment

 In addition to enrolment rates  even the quality of education given to the children to attend school is poor  The Brookings Institute s Learning Barometer  2012  provides some insights into Africa s schools  It covers 28 countries and draws on regional and national assessments to identify minimum learning thresholds for Grades 4 and 5 of primary school

The figures in Figure 18 show that over one third of pupils covered in the survey fall below the minimum threshold  with substantial variation across countries  In addition to enrolment rates  even the quality of education given to those children who attend school is poor  Figure 19   The Brooking s Institution s Learning Barometer  2012  provides some insights into Africa s schools  it covers 28 countries and draws on regional and national assessments to identify minimum learning thresholds for Grade 4 and 5 of primary school  Most worrying are the cases of Nigeria  Ethiopia and Zambia  where more than half of students in Grades 4 and 5 are below the minimum learning threshold  Even in the upper middle income countries of Namibia and South Africa  this figure is over 30 per cent 
The effects of children not learning effectively in school can be seen more clearly when African students are compared to those in other developing countries  Using TIMSS data for Grade 8 students  the results of standardized mathematics and science tests can be compared  Ranking countries from worst to best  Figure 19 shows that the five African countries do not compare favourably to comparator countries such as Turkey  Thailand and Chile  and are at the bottom of the distribution  Over 50 per cent of Grade 8 pupils in these five middle income African countries score poorly on mathematics and science  at below 475  which represents the intermediate international benchmark

For Africa  the data suggest that there is an equal collapse in the conversion rates from primary to secondary schooling as there is in the conversion from secondary to tertiary enrolment  This is in contrast to the performance of the other regions of the world  even when compared to the developing region of LAC  In essence  for Africa  the data show that for every 100 children of primary school age  only four are expected to enter a tertiary educational institution  In the LAC region  36 out of every 100 within the cohort should make it to a higher education institution  and even in South and West Asia  this figure is substantially higher than SSA  at 14 per 100 individuals  These figures highlight the rapid attrition from the schooling system and serve as a powerful indicator of the ineffectiveness of Africa s educational system  Furthermore  although not shown here  the region is also not producing graduates that match the supply characteristics  which are in demand by employers within these African economies 
Ultimately  then  the data suggest the presence of a serious deficiency in the supply of graduates from the schooling and higher education system in Africa  This is compounded by the poor quality of these graduates  In the view of long run economic growth  currently espoused by Thomas Piketty and others  human capital accumulation is one key mechanism through which to overcome a growth path where the rate of return on capital  r  exceeds the rate of economic growth  g    r g  To generate a more equal growth path  thus equalizing r and g  it is argued that the schooling and educational pipeline plays a potentially crucial role in an economy s long run growth trajectory  In Africa  on the basis of this supply side evidence  it is clear that the continent is far from producing a schooling and higher education system  which is sufficiently inequality  reducing

Box 1  Returns to schooling as a driver of inequality in South Africa
 The South African schooling  vocational training and higher education system does not currently provide the ingredients for the pursuit of longer run higher and more equal growth outcomes  We make this point below by comparing mean scores by country on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study  TIMSS   The TIMSS is an ongoing cross country standardized testing instrument  which measures mathematics and physics competence in country  at various levels of the schooling system  The survey has been ongoing since 1995 and remains one of the most widely used comparisons for educational performance  The results for South Africa reinforce the extent to which the country   in a sample of emerging market peers   lags behind considerably in schooling performance  graph not shown  
The mean scores for mathematics and science for South Africa are 1 7 and 1 8  respectively  Putting this into perspective  the global average for the two subjects was between 26 and 28 percentage points higher than that of South Africa  Hungary  Slovenia and Korea readily score twice as high  while Turkey  Thailand and Malaysia produce results are between 35 and 70 per cent higher than South Africa  Only Ghana in the sample scores below South Africa 
A more powerful reflection of the failure of the South African schooling system may lie in the production function estimates provided below  The results in Table A are based on a two stage  semi parametric production function which controls for both the simultaneity and non linearity concerns  Olley and Pakes  1996   Here  as is standard in the growth literature  the logged number of employed are measured as well as those in the population as a whole  by education level

 The results are stark  They suggest that when examining the employed only  the entire schooling pipeline does not significantly contribute to long run economic growth in the South African economy  In South Africa  a significant and positive impact on economic growth is recorded only where the employed have a qualification from a higher education institution  When the sample is switched to the population as a whole  the secondary schooling system does have some positive impact on economic growth  Ultimately  however  the evidence suggests either a weak or non responsive schooling system in South Africa with respect to impacting on productivity gains and economic growth 
The notion  then  that income inequality can be mitigated through human capital accumulation  is surely not feasible within the schooling environment in South Africa  It is not evident that South Africa is at a point at which the institutions of human capital can act as a mechanism for growth convergence 
The above suggests that on the basis of low economic growth  a divergence from the growth trajectory of high income economies and poor quality outcomes in human capital  South Africa s economic growth path would be both uneven and highly unequal  This growth path  without the channels through which to more evenly distribute the gains from growth  would be delivering growth to those with high initial endowments of land  capital and education  Indeed  this is in many ways this is a reflection of the general nature of South Africa s long run growth path  More details on the method  testing approach  questionnaire and detailed results can be found at http   timssandpirls bc edu   
  
Gender dimensions of inequality
While the labour market and educational system challenges contribute to inequality  gender disparities within these institutions are an important source of inequality in Africa  The United Nations  Gender Inequality Index is a composite measure that reflects inequality in achievement between men and women in three dimensions  reproductive health  empowerment and the labour market  where the lower the score  the closer the gender parity  In the global distribution of scores for which there is data  152 countries   only three African countries score above the median   Libya  Tunisia and Mauritius  African countries are concentrated at the upper end of the distribution  with 28 out of 39 scoring in the worst quartile  Figure 21   The South Asian countries of India  Pakistan and Bangladesh perform better on the Gender Inequality Index than countries such as Malawi  Zambia and Mozambique  which are relatively higher income countries

An important driver of gender inequality is access to education  which remains crucially important in determining individual s labour market outcomes  Since the late 1990s  there has been some progress in equalizing access to education for girls and boys in SSA  However  this has predominantly been achieved at the primary education level  Figure 22   Over this same time  there has been no progress on average in achieving gender parity in secondary schooling and there has been a widening of gender inequality in tertiary educational enrolment  This has occurred during a time when  in most other parts of the world  there have been improvements in gender parity at higher levels of education

These differences in educational attainment are important as they predict gender gaps in employment and earnings  According to the International Labour Organization s  ILO s  2012 Report on Global Employment Trends for Women  only 14 per cent of working women in Africa are in wage employment compared to 29 per cent of employed men  Just under 40 per cent of working women are contributing family members  compared to 80 per cent for men  Income is associated with empowerment and decision making power within households  where women remain disadvantaged 
In some African countries  it may not be an issue of gender discrimination per se  but one of a general lack of educational institutions to cater to the growing needs of those populations  In these cases where girls and boys compete for places at school  girls have to often sacrifice their place  Other related issues include the need for child labour to supplement household income during difficult periods  or culturally rooted biases  Gender inequality is no doubt a complex problem in Africa  as it is in some other parts of the world  and one that requires ongoing and heterogeneous policy responses

VI  Conclusion
This paper aimed to provide a broad overview of the nature and pattern of inequality in Africa  The descriptive statistics highlight that it is difficult to draw simple generalizations about the nature and pattern of inequality across Africa since there is substantial variation in both levels and changes over time  However  a few key observations do emerge  First  on average  Africa has higher than average and median inequality than the rest of the developing region  Second  a notable feature of inequality on the continent is the presence of seven economies exhibiting extremely high levels of inequality  the  African outliers   which also drive this inequality differential with the rest of the developing world  Third  over time  based on the available data  average levels of inequality have declined in Africa  driven mostly by the economies not classified as highly unequal  It also emerges that  when estimating the relationship between growth and inequality in Africa  for those countries with initially high levels of inequality  there is a stronger relationship between economic growth and inequality  a confirmation of the cross country evidence outside of Africa 
In terms of the drivers of inequality in Africa  it is shown above that the dependence on natural resources and its deleterious impact on building effective  transparent and accountable institutions remain key determinants of the high levels of inequality on the continent  Second  due to the labour market structure of many African economies  there are large proportions of the labour force involved in low income agricultural self employment or in informal sector jobs  which  when compared to the small share of wage employment in many African economies  often exacerbate inequality  The low stock of human capital is also central to this phenomenon  Individuals with a sufficient level and quality of education are able to earn high wage premia in the formal labour market  Until a large enough supply of skilled workers is available  inequality inducing skills premia will persist in African labour markets 
Clearly  growth alone is not enough to lower inequality and reduce poverty in Africa at a rapid enough pace  Growth originating from capital intensive sectors has a low likelihood of creating the kinds of formal jobs that are needed to narrow the income distribution  There is a need to enhance the industrial base of African economies and to build effective higher education institutions that are able to respond to the demands of a growing economy  This would place African economies on a more inclusive and equalizing growth path 
Policy issues
While economic growth remains crucial for policy formulation  the sources of this growth may be more so  Due to the need for economic diversification in Africa  policies to support positive structural change are key  These policies will vary from country to country  but include those related to improving agricultural productivity and nurturing key manufacturing sectors that exploit comparative advantage and are able to create decent jobs  To create decent jobs  there are clearly policies related to economic fundamentals that need to be implemented effectively  improve infrastructure in key areas  make use of information and communications technology  ICT  technology to spur growth  reform poor educational systems  and invest in research and development  R D  
In countries that are dependent on natural resources  there are key areas of reform that are need to ensure a more equitable distribution of the benefits of resource revenues  Licensing is a key portal through which rent  seeking and corrupt practices may occur  to prevent this  it is important that the process of granting licences be conducted in a transparent manner and through a fairer system such as a bidding system  Furthermore  details of mining contracts should be publicly available  as well future revenue streams generated from the sector  so that governments and large mining companies can be held accountable  These are some of international standards that EITI is seeking to establish 13

Furthermore  these resource rich countries receive large revenues flows that need to be managed better  from adequate taxation to redistributive policies such as social transfers  Regarding transfers to the poor  this is a strategy that has received increasing attention and has been suggested by several influential analyses and case studies in recent years  Gelb and Majerowicz  2011  Moss and Young  2009  Devarajan et al   2013   Based on country case studies in Africa and Latin America  evidence suggests that the cost of social security programmes in many African countries are not prohibitive  Tax revenues lost due to illicit capital flows would be sufficient to cover social protection programmes many times over  In essence  then  a  starter pack  in social protection may be a policy intervention worthy of serious consideration  This  pack  can have significant poverty reduction effects and does not necessarily constitute a very high share of GDP  and is thus particularly affordable for all of Africa s resource dependent economies 
The role of education in improving people s labour market outcomes is a key channel through which inequality can be reduced  There are three key areas of educational system reform required  First  there is the need to increase enrolment rates at secondary school level and tertiary education  since these are the critical levels of education that provide the necessary skills for individuals to be productive in the labour market  Second  the enhancement of learning outcomes for those in school is critical  To this end  teachers need to be adequately trained  investment should be made in schooling infrastructure  and teachers should make use of technology as learning aids where possible  Finally  providing incentives for sending children to school  especially girls who remain disadvantaged  will be critical in unleashing the productive power of women and youth in Africa 
The state and its institutions play a central role in reducing inequality  Mechanisms to keep in the state in check need to be put in place to prevent the use of state resources for personal gain  Capacity building within the state is also critical for the effective implementation and monitoring of development policy  Furthermore  the state has an important role in fostering social cohesion in ethnically diverse societies  This can be achieved by educating people about diversity and by removing discriminatory elements such as forms of discrimination against minority groups in the labour market 
Furthermore  there are some key areas of research that are required to inform the African policy agenda more concretely  First  the continued focus on improving the statistical capacity of African countries is important for ensuring that quality research can be conducted  Second  country specific research at the microeconomic level is needed to more accurately understand the evolution and drivers of inequality   i e  asset  income  horizontal and other forms   given any country s specific historical and institutional setting  Finally  there is also a key need to understand the dynamics of the growth poverty inequality relationship for specific groups of countries  for example  countries that are dependent on natural resources  fragile states or post conflict economies
