-In most parts of the world, crowding people together allows businesses that wouldnâ€™t otherwise exist to thrive...Africa is the only region where urbanisation is not correlated with poverty reduction.. What sets them apart from cities elsewhere is that urbanisation has not been driven by increasing <a href="ianssmith.github.io/major-studio-1/quantData/indexAG.html">agricultural</a> productivity..African cities are centres of consumption, where the rents extracted from natural resources are spent by the rich. This means that they have grown while failing to install the <a href="ianssmith.github.io/major-studio-1/quantData/index.html">infrastructure</a> that makes cities elsewhere work.-

<h1>Why African cities don't make their residents richer</h1>
<blockquote cite="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/10/economist-explains-1">
-In other parts of the world, increasing agricultural productivity and industrialisation went together. More productive farmers meant there was a surplus that could feed cities; in turn, that created a pool of labour for factories...African cities, are too often built around consuming the rents extracted from natural resources.-
